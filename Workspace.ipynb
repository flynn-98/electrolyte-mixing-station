To compensate for this, an extra variable is included to slow down the rate of aspiration in an attempt to lower the pressure change required to aspirate more viscous fluids. Ignoring the response time of the pressure PID controller, the aspirate speed will determine how quickly the pressure of the disc pump changes. A typical value would be **10uL/s**.\n",
