    "Based on the [literature](https://www.theleeco.com/uploads/2023/06/AN049-Pipetting-Disc-Pump-Application-Note-1.pdf), we can expect the aspirate constant to be roughly equal to the system pressure $P_r$ divided by the reservoir volume $V_r$. The system pressure can be assumed equal to atmospheric pressure $\\approx$ 1000mbar and the chosen reservoir volume is 2500uL $\\implies$ the constant should be about **0.4mbar/uL**.\n",

    "For more viscous liquids, this value may increase based on the ohm's law equivalent of fluid flow through a pipe (the Hagen-Poiseuille equation). To compensate for this, an extra variable is included to slow down the rate of aspiration in an attempt to lower the pressure change required to aspirate more viscous fluids. Along with the response time of the pressure PID controller, the aspirate speed will determine how quickly the pressure of the disc pump changes. A typical value would be **10uL/s**.\n",
